# AutomatedSegmentation
This project focuses on automated data segmentation aimed at highlighting the placentas, hearts, and livers of mouse fetuses in ultrasound images using color outlines. Each ultrasound image contains a random number of mouse fetuses. Our goal is to train an algorithm capable of identifying and outlining the visible hearts, livers, and placentas in these images through segmentation techniques.

The dataset consists of approximately 200 images, each with a varying number of mouse fetuses. Each image is accompanied by a .roi (Region of Interest) file that delineates the locations of the livers, placentas, and hearts. Each .roi file is labeled to indicate whether it corresponds to livers, placentas, or hearts.

In this project, we have achieved promising results, successfully outlining visible livers with an accuracy of 89%, visible hearts with 92%, and visible placentas with 82%.
